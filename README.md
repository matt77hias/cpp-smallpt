## About
C++ modification of Kevin Baeson's [99 line C++ path tracer](http://www.kevinbeason.com/smallpt/)

**Note** that I deliberately chose for the same software design for [all programming languages](https://github.com/matt77hias/smallpt) out of clarity and performance reasons (this can conflict with the nature of declarative/functional programming languages).
